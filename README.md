Experiments and small projects exploring data ingestion, transformation and pipelines. 

This repository contains experiments and small projects focused on data engineering concepts such as data ingestion, transformation, and storage.

## Motivation
I am using this space to strengthen my understanding of how raw data is collected, processed, and prepared for analysis or machine learning.

## Contents
- Data ingestion scripts
- Data cleaning and transformation notebooks
- Simple ETL pipelines

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- SQL
- Docker (learning)
- Git

## Status
🟡 In progress

## Next Steps
- Build a simple ETL pipeline using real-world data
- Add basic data validation and logging
